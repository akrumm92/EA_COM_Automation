The Object Model is accessible either from internal or external scriptingenvironments or through Add-Ins. This is a convenient feature that ensures that a programmer is insulated from theunderlying database where the repository is stored, protecting them from changes to the database structure or content.The objects are grouped into Packages and contain a useful, extensive and well documented set of properties andmethods that are intuitive to use and allow access to elements, features, diagrams and project metadata.Automation provides a way for other applications to access the information in an Enterprise Architect model usingWindows OLE Automation (ActiveX). Typically this involves scripting clients such as MS WordTM or Visual Basic, orusing scripts created within Enterprise Architect using the Scripting window.The Automation Interface provides a way of accessing the internals of Enterprise Architect models. Examples of thingsyou can do using the Automation Interface include:Perform repetitive tasks, such as update the version number for all elements in a model·Generate code from a StateMachine diagram·Produce custom reports·Perform ad hoc queries·FeaturesFeature Description Connecting to theAutomation Interface All development environments capable of generating ActiveX COM clients shouldbe able to connect to the Enterprise Architect Automation Interface. This guideprovides detailed instructions on connecting to the interface using Microsoft VisualBasic 6.0, Borland Delphi 7.0, Microsoft C# and Java. There are also more detailedsteps on how to set-up Visual Basic; the principles are applicable to otherlanguages. Examples and Tips Instruction on how to use the Automation Interface is provided by means of samplecode. See pointers to the samples and other available resources. Also, consult theextensive Reference Section. Calling Executables fromEnterprise Architect Enterprise Architect can be set up to call an external application. You can passparameters on the current position selected in the Browser window to theapplication being called. For instructions, go to the Call from Enterprise Architecttopic. A more sophisticated method is to create Add-Ins, which are discussed in aseparate section. Using the Automation InterfacThis section provides instructions on how to connect to and use the Automation Interface, including:Connecting to the interface·Setting references in Visual Basic·Examples and Tips·Connect to the InterfaceAll development environments capable of generating ActiveX Com clients can connect to the Enterprise ArchitectAutomation Interface.By way of example, these sections describe how to connect using several such tools. The procedure might vary slightlywith different versions of these products.Microsoft Visual Basic 6.This procedure caters for the syntax and frameworks of version 6.0. More recent versions have the same framework asother .Net languages with only syntax differences, and therefore use a similar process to that described for Microsoft C#,later in this topic.Step Action 1 Create a new project. 2 Select the 'Project | References' menu option. 3 Select Enterprise Architect Object Model 2.0 from the list.If this does not appear, go to the command line and re-register Enterprise Architect using:      EA.exe /unregisterthen      EA.exe /register 4 See the general library documentation on the use of Classes. This example creates and opens a repositoryobject:      Public Sub ShowRepository()            Dim MyRep As New EA.Repository            MyRep.OpenFile "c:\eatest.eap"      End Sub Borland Delphi 7.0Note that recent versions of Delphi are developed by Embarcadero.Step Action 1 Create a new project. 2 Select the 'Project | Import Type Library' menu option. 3 Select Enterprise Architect Object Model 2.0 from the list.If this does not appear, go to the command line and re-register Enterprise Architect using:      EA.exe /unregisterthen      EA.exe /register 4 Click on the Create Unit button. 5 Include EA_TLB in Project1's Uses clause. 6 See the general library documentation on the use of Classes. This example creates and opens a repositoryobject:      procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);      var      r: TRepository;      b: boolean;      begin      r:= TRepository.Create(nil);      b:= r.OpenFile('c:\eatest.eap');      end; Microsoft CStep Action 1 Select the 'Visual Studio Project | Add Reference' menu option. 2 Click on the 'Browse' tab. 3 Navigate to the folder in which you installed Enterprise Architect; usually:      Program Files/Sparx Systems/EASelect      Interop.EA.dll 4 See the general library documentation on the use of Classes. This example creates and opens a repositoryobject:      private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)      {      EA.Repository r = new EA.Repository();      r.OpenFile("c:\\eatest.eap");      } JavaStep Action 1 Copy the file:      SSJavaCOM.dllfrom the Java API subdirectory of your installed directory, usually:      Program Files/Sparx Systems/EAinto any location within the Windows PATH      windows\system32 directory.Note: The Java API loads the last installed Enterprise Architect and isn't affected when using either the 32or 64 Version of DLL, as long as the SSJavaCOM dll can be found by the java runtime. 2 Copy the file      eaapi.jarfrom the Java API subdirectory of your installed directory, usually:      Program Files/Sparx Systems/EAto a location in the Java CLASSPATH or where the Java class loader can find it at run time. 3 All of the Classes described in the documentation are in the Package org.sparx. See the general librarydocumentation for their use. This example creates and opens a repository object:      public void OpenRepository()      {      org.sparx.Repository r = new org.sparx.Repository();      r.OpenFile("c:\\eatest.eap");      } Set References In Visual BasicIt is possible to use the Enterprise Architect ActiveX interface with Visual Basic (VB). Use is ensured for Visual Basicversion 6, but might vary slightly with versions other than version 6.It is assumed that you have accessed VB through a Microsoft Application such as VB 6.0, MS WordTM or MS Access. Ifthe code is not called from within Word, the Word VB reference must also be set.On creating a new VB project, you set a reference to an Enterprise Architect Type Library and a Word Type Library.Set ReferencesStep Action 1 Select the 'Tools | References' menu option. 2 Select the 'Enterprise Architect Object Model 2.10' checkbox from the list. 3 Do the same for VB or VB Word: select the checkbox for the 'Microsoft Word 10.0 Object Library'. 4 Click on the OK button. NotesIf 'Enterprise Architect Object Model 2.10' does not appear in the list, go to the command line and manually re-enter·Enterprise Architect using:     -  (To unregister Enterprise Architect) ea.exe /unregister     -  (To register Enterprise Architect) ea.exe /registerVisual Basic 5/6 users should also note that the version number of the Enterprise Architect interface is stored in the·VBP project file in a form similar to this:     Reference=*\G{64FB2BF4-9EFA-11D2-8307-C45586000000}#2.2#0#..\..\..\..\Program Files\     Sparx Systems\EA\EA.TLB#Enterprise Architect Object Model 2.02If you experience problems moving from one version of Enterprise Architect to another, open the VBP file in a texteditor and remove this line, then open the project in Visual Basic and use Project-References to create a newreference to the Enterprise Architect Object modelReference to objects in Enterprise Architect and Word should now be available in the Object Browser, which can beaccessed from the main menu by pressing F2The drop-down list on the top-left of the window should now include Enterprise Architect and Word; if MS-Projectis installed, also set this upExamples and TipsPoints to consider··········Subject Points Examples Instructions for using the interface are provided through sample code. There areseveral sets of examples:VB 6 and C# examples are available in the Code Samples folder under yourEnterprise Architect installation(default: C:\Program Files\Sparx Systems\EA\Code Samples)Enterprise Architect can be set up to call an external applicationSeveral VB.NET code snippets are provided in the reference sectionA comprehensive example of using Visual Basic to create MS WordTMdocumentation is available from the internet atsparxsystems.com/resources/developers/autint_vb.htmlAdditional samples are available from the Sparx Systems website; see theAvailable Resources topic Tips and Tricks Also note these tips and tricks:An instance of the Enterprise Architect (EA.exe) process is executed when youinitialize a new repository object - this process must remain running in order toperform automation tasks; if the main window is visible, you can safelyminimize it, but it must remain runningThe Enterprise Architect ActiveX Interface is a functional interface rather thana data interface; when you load data through the interface there is a noticeabledelay as Enterprise Architect user interface elements (such as Windows andmenus) are loaded and the specified database connection is establishedCollections use a zero-based index; for example, Repository.Models(0)represents the first model in the repositoryDuring the development of your client software your program might terminateunexpectedly and leave EA.exe running in such a state that it is unable tosupport further interface calls; if your program terminates abnormally, ensurethat Enterprise Architect is not left running in the background (see theWindows 'Task Manager / Process' tab)A handle to a currently running instance of Enterprise Architect can beobtained through the use of a GetObject() call (see the reference page for theApp object); accessing your Enterprise Architect model via the App objectenables querying the current User Interface status, such as usingGetContextItem() on the Repository object to detect the current selection bythe user, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing Enterprise Architect NotClosing After all processing by an automation controller is complete, it is recommended tocall CloseFile() and Exit() on the Repository object, then set all references to therepository object to null.     repository.CloseFile();     repository.Exit();     repository = null;If your automation controller was written using the .NET framework, EnterpriseArchitect does not close even after you release all your references to it. To force the     GC.Collect();     GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();There are additional concerns when controlling a running instance of EnterpriseArchitect that loads Add-Ins - see the Tricks and Traps topic for details. Call from Enterprise ArchitectEnterprise Architect can be set up to call an external application. You can pass parameters on the current positionselected in the Browser window to the application being called. This helps you to:Add a command line for an application·Define parameters to pass to this application·The parameters required for running the AutInt executable are:The Enterprise Architect file parameter $f and·The current PackageID $p·Hence the arguments should simply contain: $f,$p.Once this has been set up, the application can be called from the 'Extend' ribbon in Enterprise Architect using the 'Extend> <YourApplication>' option.AccessRibbon Start > Appearance > Preferences > Other Options > Tools Parameters to pass information to external applicatioParameter Description $d Diagram IDNotes: ID for accessing associated diagram. $D Diagram GUIDNotes: GUID for accessing the associated diagram. $e Comma separated list of element IDsNotes: All elements selected in the current diagram. $E Comma separated list of element GUIDsNotes: All elements selected in the current diagram. $f Project NameNotes: For example: C:\projects\EAexample.eap. $F Calling Application (Enterprise Architect)Notes: 'Enterprise Architect'. $p Current Package IDNotes: For example: 144. $P Package GUIDNotes: GUID for accessing this Package. Available ResourcesResourcesAvailable resources include:Resource Download Link VB 6 Add-In forgenerating MS Worddocumentation. sparxsystems.com/resources/developers/autint_vb.html VB 6 Add-In to display acustom ActiveX graphcontrol within theEnterprise Architectwindow as a new view. sparxsystems.com/resources/developers/autint_vb_custom_view.html A basic Add-In frameworkwritten in C#.

Each UML element in this User Guidecan be created by Automation and can be accessed either through the various collections that exist or, in some cases,directly.The Repository Class is the starting point for all use of the Automation Interface. It contains the high level systemobjects and entry point into the model itself using the Models collection and the other system-level collections.App ObjectThe App object represents a running instance of Enterprise Architect. Its object provides access to the AutomationInterface.AttributeAttribute Type Project ProjectNotes: Read onlyProvides a handle to the Project Interface. Repository RepositoryNotes: Read onlyProvides a handle to the Repository object. Visible BooleanNotes: Read/WriteWhether or not the application is visible. GetObject() SupportThe App object is createable and a handle can be obtained by creating one. In addition, clients can use the equivalent ofVisual Basic's GetObject() to obtain a reference to a currently running instance of Enterprise Architect.Use this method to more quickly test changes to Add-Ins and external clients, as the Enterprise Architect application anddata files do not have to be constantly re-loaded.For example:     Dim App as EA.App     Set App = GetObject(,"EA.App")     MsgBox App.Repository.Models.CountAnother example, which uses the App object without saving it to a variable:     Dim Rep as EA.Repository     Set Rep = GetObject(, "EA.App").Repository     MsgBox Rep.ConnectionStringEnumerationThese enumerations are defined by the Automation Interface:Automation Interface EnumeratioEnumeration Link Constant Layout Styles Constant Layout Styles Create Baseline Flag Create Baseline Flag Create Model Type Create Model Type Document Break Document Break Document PageOrientation Document Page Orientation Document Type Document Type Enterprise ArchitectEdition Types Enterprise Architect Edition Types Enumeration Relation SetType Enumeration Relation Set Type Export Package XMI Flag Export Package XMI Flag Mail Interface MessageFlag Mail Interface Message Flag MDG Menus MDG Menus Object Type Object Type PropType PropType Reload Type Reload Type Scenario Diagram Type Scenario Diagram Type Scenario Step Type Scenario Step Type Scenario Test Type Scenario Test Type XMI Type XMI Type ConstLayoutStylesThe enum values defined here are used exclusively for the 'Lay Out a Diagram' method.

It contains methods toiterate through the collection, refresh the collection and delete an item from the collection.It is important to realize that when the 'AddNew' function is called, the item is not automatically added to the currentcollection. The typical steps are:Call AddNew to add a new item·Modify the item as required·Call Update on the item to save it to the database·Call Refresh on the collection to include it in the current set·Delete is the same; until Refresh is called, the collection still contains a reference to the deleted item, which should notbe called.Each method can be used to iterate through the collection for languages that support this type of construct.Collection AttributAttribute Remarks Count ShortNotes: Read onlyThe number of objects referenced by this list. ObjectType ObjectTypeNotes: Read onlyDistinguishes objects referenced through a Dispatch interface. Collection Method·······Method Remarks AddNew(string Name,string Type) ObjectNotes: Adds a new item to the current collection.The interface is the same for all collections; you must provide a Name and Typeargument. What these arguments are used for depends on the actual collection beingaccessed. For example, when adding a new element to the Elements collection, theType string can be either a basic UML element type or a fully qualified elementtype (stereotype) defined by a profile, such as SysML::Requirement, differentiatingit from a standard requirement.Also note that you must call Update() on the returned object to complete theAddNew function. If Update() is not called the object is left in an indeterminatestate.When an error occurs an exception will be thrown, including when the user doesnot have Security permission to modify the specify type.Parameters:Name: StringType: String (up to 30 characters long) Delete(short index) VoidNotes: Deletes the item at the selected reference.Parameters:index: Short DeleteAt(short index,boolean Refresh) VoidNotes: Deletes the item at the selected index. The second parameter is currentlyunused.Parameters:index: ShortRefresh: Boolean GetAt(short index) ObjectNotes: Retrieves the array object using a numerical index. If the index is out ofbounds, an error occurs.Parameters:index: Short GetByName(string Name) ObjectNotes: Gets an item in the current collection by name. Supported for Model,Package, Element, Diagram and element TaggedValue collections.If the collection does not contain any items (or, for the Tagged Value collection, ifthe collection contains items but the method cannot locate an object with thespecified name) the method returns a null value. For other collections, if the methodis unable to find an object with the specified name, it raises an exception.Parameters:Name: String GetLastError() StringNotes: Returns a string value describing the most recent error that occurred inrelation to this object. Refresh() VoidNotes: Refreshes the collection by re-querying the model and reloading thecollection. Should be called after adding a new item or after deleting an item. Update() BooleanNotes: Updates the current Collection object after modification or appending a newitem.If False is returned, check the 'GetLastError()' function for more information. The AddNew FunctioThe AddNew() function is used widely across the API to add new objects to a Collection. In all cases you must provide aName and Type argument, but what these arguments are used for depends on the actual collection being accessed. Forexample, when adding a new element to the Elements collection, the 'Type' string can be either a basic UML elementtype or a fully qualified element type (stereotype) defined by a profile, such as SysML::Requirement differentiated froma standard requirement.AddNew Attribute ArgumentThis table provides guidance in specifying the AddNew arguments for each of the object attributes.Attribute Arguments AttributeConstraints Name - The name of the constraint.Type - The constraint type Attributes Name - The name of the attribute.Type - The attribute type. AttributesEx Name - The name of the attribute.Type - The attribute type. AttributeTags Name - The fully-qualified name, or plain text.Type - The value of the Tagged Value. Authors Name - The author name.Type - The author role. Clients Name - The client name.Type - The client role. ConnectorConstraints Name - The name of the constraint.Type - The constraint type. ConnectorConveyedItems Name - The GUID of an element.Type - Not used.Note: This does not return an object. Connectors Name - The name of the connector.Type - The connector type (for example 'Realization'). ConnectorTags Name - The fully-qualified name, or plain text.Type - The value of the Tagged Value. Constraints Name - The name of the constraint.Type - The constraint type. ConstraintsEx Name - The name of the constraint.Type - The constraint type. CustomProperties You cannot create these. DataTypes Name - The datatype name.Type - The datatype type. DiagramLinks Name - Not used.Type - The style string (such as 'l=200;r=400;t=200;b=600;')(You might prefer to leave the Type empty and use the Functions on this interfacefor size, colors and so on). DiagramObjects Name - This can either be an empty string, or it can specify the initial Left, Right,Top and Bottom values for the new DiagramObject.

it provides nobenefit when the model is hosted in a single shared database that is accessed by allteam members.Each controlled Package is compared with its associated XMI file and, if thecross-reference information in the model does not match the XMI, EnterpriseArchitect updates the model with the information from the XMI and records theupdate in the System Output window.You can roll back such updates by right-clicking on the entry in the System Outputwindow and selecting the 'Rollback Update' option (or 'Rollback Selected Updates'if multiple entries are selected).Closing the model clears the entries in the System Output window; an entry in thiswindow is also cleared as and when you roll-back the update for it.This functionality is invoked automatically as part of the 'Get All Latest' operation.When working in an environment that uses a Private Model deployment and yourmodel contains a significant number of cross-Package references, it isrecommended that you invoke this function from time to time, following there-importation of controlled Packages - for example, after using 'Get Latest' toupdate a number of Packages, or after performing a number of Package check-outs.As a general rule, avoid running this function while you have uncommitted changesin your model.

It effectivelyshows the properties contained in the technology-specific and custom categories of the Properties window for the object(and omits the Enterprise Architect specific properties such as the General and Project properties). The interface hidesthe origin of the properties - whether they are from the base object directly, a Tagged Value, or are MOF properties.You can see this interface in action in the EA.Example model ('Start > Help > Help > Open the Example Model'). Whenyou open this model:Select the 'Specialize > Manage Addin' ribbon option.1.Select the checkbox against 'Type Info' and click on the OK button. An icon for 'Type Info' displays on the right of2.the Add-Ins panel.Click on the drop-down arrow and select the 'Show Type Info' option. The Add-Ins window displays, showing the3.type information (properties) for the currently-selected object.If you also want to display custom properties in the Add-Ins window, click on the 'Type-Info' icon again and select4.the 'Include Custom Properties option'. The window resembles this illustration, which is for a UML Componentelement.Browse the EA.Example model, clicking on different types of object. You will see a different list of properties for,5.say, an Action than for a Class. Then you can both read and write to those properties. Also compare the list with theProperties window for the same objects.TypeInfoProperties ClasTypeInfoProperties AttributAttribute Remarks Count longReturns the number of TypeInfo Properties. ObjectType ObjectTypeNotes: Read onlyDistinguishes objects referenced through a Dispatch interface. TypeInfoProperties Method·····Method Remarks GetLastError () StringNotes: Returns a string value describing the most recent error that occurred inrelation to this object. GetProperty (StringPropName) Returns the property value as a string.Parameters:PropName : String - Name of the property HasProperty (StringPropName) Returns True if the object has the property.Parameters:PropName : String - Name of the property Items (object Index) TypeInfoProperty collectionNotes: Accesses an individual TypeInfoProperty.Parameters:Index: Object - Either a string representing the title text or an integerrepresenting the zero-based index of the TypeInfoProperty to get SetProperty (StringPropName, String Value) Returns True if the property was set.Parameters:PropName : String - Name of propertyValue : String - Value of property TypeInfoProperty ClassTypeInfoProperty AttributeAttribute Remarks Name StringNotes: Readonly.Name of the property. ObjectType ObjectTypeNotes: Read onlyDistinguishes objects referenced through a Dispatch interface. Value StringGet/Sets the Property value. TypeInfoProperty Methods<None.>Method Remarks Mail Interface PackageThe MailInterface Package contains:A function to retrieve a pointer to the interface·Functions to create and send a mail message within the current mode·Utility functions for creating hyperlinks to selected model elements·You can get a pointer to this interface using the method Repository.GetMailInterface.MailInterface ClassThe MailInterface interface can be accessed from the Repository using GetMailInterface().
